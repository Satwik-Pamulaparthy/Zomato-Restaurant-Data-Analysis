## üìÅ Projects & Case Studies

### 1. Cyclistic Bike-Share: Marketing Strategy Case Study

*This case study analyzes 12 months (from 2024-07 to 2025-06) of historical  trip data from a fictional Chicago bike-share company to understand the behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders. The goal was to provide data-driven recommendations to convert casual riders into more profitable annual members.*

* **Key Insight:** Discovered that casual riders primarily use the service for leisure trips on weekends, while annual members use it for shorter, more frequent commuter trips during the week. This suggests distinct marketing strategies are needed for each segment.
* **My Process:**
    * Collected and aggregated 12 months of data using **SQL** in SQL Server Management Studio.
    * Cleaned, processed, and analyzed the data using **SQL** in SQL Server Management Studio.
    * Created visualizations using **R** and the Tidyverse package to illustrate the differences in ride duration, time of day, and day of the week between user types.
* **Tools Used:** `SQL`, `R (Tidyverse)`.
### 2. # üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis
*This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio and presents an in-depth analysis of restaurant data sourced from Zomato, a prominent restaurant search and discovery service.
